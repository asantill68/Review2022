Lesson01:
HTML, Tags, CSS, CSS Reset, Selectors (element, class, id)

Lesson02:  
Semantics - element gives content on the page meaning and structure;

div is a block while span is more for inline content
Block Elements start a new line
InLine Elements do not
Text-based Elements: H1 to H6, p, strong, bold b, emphasis em and italics i elements
Structure based elements (block): header, nav, article, section, aside and footer
header outlines the heading of a segment or page and is not to be used as an h element
nav is for navigation links on a page to other pages or sections of the website
article is to identify a section of independent, self-contained content
